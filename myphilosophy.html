              As many know, living with a mental illness is not easy and it is especially
              lonely due to the stigma surrounding it. In my early teens I struggled a lot
              with my mental health and looking back at my experiences the only part that 
              I wish had been different was having someone that I could talk to 
              about what I was going through. ​<br /><br />
              I created this website because I want to help others who feel the
              same way I did, to me having someone to talk to would have made
              dealing with my mental health struggles less lonely. I also would like
              to raise awareness about the use of support groups that assist with mental
              health. It is a common universal thought that the only way to
              support someone dealing with a mental illness is by seeking
              professional help. This may be true in some aspects; however, the
              use of support groups and discussion circles can help those who
              are not ready to seek out professional help by allowing them to
              express their feelings and to know that they are not alone in
              their battles.
              <br />
              <br />
              With that being said, welcome to my circle, feel free to stay a while &hearts;
