      <h1>De-escalating Your Anxiety</h1>
      <p>
        My anxiety sneaks up on me at random times throughout the day. Some days
        it’ll be on my way to school and other days it’ll be at home. When I first 
        started experiencing anxiety it took a toll on my health; however,
        I now use some techniques I've learned along my journey to help with 
        my experiences with anxiety.

      <h1>Understand</h1>
      <p>
        Understand what anxiety and panic attacks are and why they happen. A panic 
        attack is a sudden onset of fear and discomfort that lasts a few minutes. 
        Symptoms of a panic attack include increased heart rate, sweating, 
        shortness of breath, and trembling. Panic attacks are often caused 
        by excessive stress from our unpredictable lives but they can also be 
        caused by medical conditions or traumatic events. An anxiety attack is
       different from a panic attack. Anxiety attacks involve fear of a specific 
       trigger such as an upcoming event or a health problem. Symptoms of an anxiety 
       attack include worry, restlessness, sweating, a sense of endangerment and 
       increased heart rate.          
       <br /><br />
        Once you understand what anxiety and panic attacks are, you can recognize 
        when it is happening and find a comfortable space to calm yourself down.

      <p>
        Recognize that you are having a panic or anxiety attack. Remind yourself 
        that it is not harmful, and by recognizing that you are having one
        you are taking away the fear involved. Acknowledge that your body will 
        take a few minutes to get your adrenaline levels back to normal and 
        reassure yourself that what you are feeling is temporary and will pass.

      <h1>Take Deep Breaths</h1>
      <p>
        Hyperventilating is a symptom of anxiety and although it has been said
        over and over again, it really helps to take deep breaths and let your
        mind drift off. Focus on something around you or on you, such as your 
        fingers nails. While focusing on that one object, take in deep breaths 
        through your nose and out your mouth. While taking deep breaths, assure 
        yourself that you are okay.

      <p>
        Try to limit the consumption of coffee, cigarettes and alcohol. Any
        drink with a lot of caffeine will make you feel jittery and may
        ultimately be what is triggering your anxiety. Cigarettes and alcohol 
        have also been linked to increasing anxiety levels, although they may
        calm you down at first, later on will they will make you feel jittery,
        contributing to your anxiety.

      <p>
        Anxiety and panic attacks often come from visual triggers that overwhelm you. 
        Close your eyes and allow yourself to visualize something positive. Picture 
        something you love doing whether it is painting in your room or riding a bike 
        around the neighbourhood. This positive mental image will help you relax and 
        calm down after experiencing anxiety.

        the neighbourhood can help you calm down and focus on other things like

  Another technique I’ve found to be helpful is the common 3-3-3 challenge. 
  If you find yourself feeling overwhelmed, whether in public or in private, look 
  around and name 3 objects you see, 3 sounds you hear and finally, move 3 of your 
  body parts. This challenge helps you calm down and gets your mind to slow down a bit.

      <h1>What You Eat</h1>
      <p>
        One of the most important factors of your mood is your diet. What you
        eat can contribute to how you feel. Stay away from caffeine and sugary
        foods/drinks as they can affect your mood. This doesn’t mean you can’t
        have anything that contains sugar or caffeine ( I love my morning coffee)
        but limit it to a small amount. Some healthy and nutritious options I 
        enjoy are mangos, brocolli, kale with lemon and grilled chicken breast.

        also helps you focus on other aspects of your life by reducing your worry

        have studied the effects sleep has on one's mood. Researchers found  
        that even slight sleep deprivation has a correlational effect on your mood.
        Not enough sleep can cause irritability and stress, while sleeping for at least 7 
        hours can enhance your mood. Create a sleep chedule that allows you to have 
        around 7 hours of sleep. When getting ready to sleep, stay away from caffeinated 
        and sugary foods/drinks. Also make sure to stay away from bright lights or screens.

      <h1>Exercise</h1>
      <p>
        From experience anyone can say that exercise makes you feel good. The
        reason why you should start exercising regularly is that exercise
        actually increases your level of endorphins. Endorphins are natural mood
        lifters. Exercise can also help improve your mood by getting your sleep
        patterns back to normal. Regularly exercising can also reduce stress and
        symptoms of mental health conditions like depression and anxiety.

        Writing is a great way to improve your mood and mental health. Purchase or make

        Writing down your thoughts and feelings helps you gain control of your emotions 
        while improving your mental health. If you struggle with stress, depression, 
        or anxiety, writing in a journal is a good way to alleviate some of those feelings

      <h1>Take a bath</h1>
      <p>
        Many people claim that taking a hot bath helps improve their mood, but is
        it true? Studies show that heating up your body assists in muscle
        relaxation which in return boosts your mood. Researchers at the University 
        of Freiburg in Germany discovered a correlation that by regularly increasing 
        people’s body temperatures they were able to improve their internal clock 
        which resulted in lessening some of their symptoms of depression. From 
        experience, when I get into a bad mood, taking a hot bath has always made 
        me calm down and think more clearly. <br />

          Our perception of the control we have in our lives can affect our

          thoughts try to reframe them. For instance, instead of thinking “I am 
          always going to fail” try reframing to “this wasn’t my best attempt 
          but there is always another chance”. Remind yourself that everyday 
          there is a new opportunity to try again.

            <h1>Mindfulness Meditation</h1>
            <p>
                  What Is Mindfulness? 
                  Mindfulness is a way of learning to relate differently to one’s own mind, it is a nonjudging meditation 
                  technique in which the goal is to achieve a state of focused relaxation by paying attention to one's thoughts 
                  without judgement.  
                  <br /><br />
                  To practice mindfulness you should:  
                  <br /><br />
                  1.Attend closely to a bodily sensation (I focus on the air coming into my nose)
                <br /><br />
                2.When a mental event arises simply notice it without judgment or elaboration (don't 
                think about whether it's good or bad)
                <br><br>
                3. Become aware of your surroundings (sounds, smells etc.) then embrace your thoughts. For example, 
            when thinking about something you said last night don't think of it as good or bad, it happened, it passed 
            and now its over.

            4.Return attention back to the bodily sensation <br>
            <br />
            If you feel your mind is starting to race, focus back on your bodily sensation and start 
            to slowly let your thoughts in again.
            <br>
            <br />What mindfulness attempts to do is form a mode of attention that is first anchored 
            to the present-moment attention, rather than one that is constantly being swept away 
            by thought streams of past events or future anticipations.
            <br>
            A randomized controlled trial of mindfulness meditation vs relaxing training by Shamini Jain,
            Shauna L. Shapiro, Summer Swanick, Scott C. Roesch, Paul J. Mills, Iris Bell and Gary E.R Swartz 
            demonstrates the effects on distress, positive states of mind, rumination and distraction.
            The study found that practicing mindfulness meditation assists in reducing distress and increases 
            your own positive state of mind.
